Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
==========================
As Twitter is a major platform for the people to express their opinions, we can analyse their opinions on a particular item and
those analysis can act as a review to the companies. My project gets the Tweets(100 tweets) from the Twitter for an entered keyword, 
analyses them and gives the result as positive/negative/neutral for every tweet returned. I’ve used Twitter4j api to get the Tweets from 
Twitter I’ve made my "own algorithm" to analyse the returned tweets, I followed Lexicon approach for this analysis. 
This project also     
  -> compares two keywords (Apple vs Samsung)      
  -> Gets the history of the sentiments of a keyword ( incase if we want to find out the sentiments of iPhone 6 before it got bent and after the bent reviews, it can go up to maximum of 7 days) 
  -> It can also get the tweets from a country.(sentiments of people from America on Apple and from India etc)

For more and detailed description about my project, there is a PDF file called "projectDocumentation" attached in the project files.
